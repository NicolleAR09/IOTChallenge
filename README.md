### CROP MONITORING 
This repository contains two codes for a crop monitoring system. The purpose is to measure variables like temperature, humidity, and soil humidity of the plants using 2 nodes, a transmitter, and a receiver. The TxTEST2 code is for the transmitter and RxTEST is for the receiver. 
Both nodes use a nRF24L01 module for data transmission, which are connected to an Arduino, being this the microcontroller and principal brain of the whole project. To the Arduino are also connected the sensors for each variable.
